## Project: Bagel

Bagel is a desktop flashcard application based off AddressBook - Level 3. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view individual flashcards.
  * What it does: allows the user to view one flashcard at a time.
