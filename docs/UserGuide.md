## FAQ

## Glossary

* __Set__: It acts similarly to a folder in the real world. If you want to categorize your flashcards, you can make use of 
the 'set' feature to place each flashcard into different sets.

* __Duplicate flashcard__: Two flashcards that have the same title and description are considered duplicate flashcards.
Duplicate flashcards are disallowed, even if they have different links, set numbers, or tags. This is to ensure that users will not make a mistake
while adding flashcards, and to prevent confusion.
