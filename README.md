* This is a project for CS2103T, an NUS module. Itâ€™s intended usage is for making flashcards for GER1000, another NUS module.

* It is named `Bagel` because we thought it was catchy.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Bagel Product Website] (ay2021s1-cs2103t-w13-2.github.io/tp/)**.

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
